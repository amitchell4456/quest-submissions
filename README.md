Users of the smart contract need to know their assets are safe or they will not use your blockchain. 2. Clarity is important because it makes harder for developers to make mistakes. It also makes it easier to debug code. 3. Approachability is important because it will allow for more developers to try coding. The people who try coding the more people will be a part of the Web 3 world. 4. Developer Experience is important because it keeps skilled and productive developers on Cadence and makes it less likely they will leave to develop in a different coding language. The more skilled developers there are, the better the Flow experience will be.
